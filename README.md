## Usage:

## Environment:
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) - code formatter just to keep code neat and tidy

## Tools:
- [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) - to work with CSS classnames and keep it readable (can't live without this tool)

## Implementation:

I've used `App` component as a layout to avoid creating seperate component for this.
